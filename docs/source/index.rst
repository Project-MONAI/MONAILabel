*Medical Open Network for AI*

MONAI Label is an intelligent open source image labeling and learning tool that enables
users to create annotated datasets and build AI annotation models for clinical evaluation.
MONAI Label enables application developers to build labeling apps in a *serverless* way,
where custom labeling apps are exposed as a service through the MONAI Label Server.

MONAI Label reduces the time and effort of annotating new datasets and enables the adaptation
of AI to the task at hand by continuously learning from user interactions and data. MONAI Label
allows researchers and developers to make continuous improvements to their apps by allowing them
to interact with their apps at the user would. End-users (clinicians, technologists, and annotators
in general) benefit from AI continuously learning and becoming better at understanding what the
end-user is trying to annotate.

MONAI Label aims to fill the gap between developers creating new annotation applications, and
the end users which want to benefit from these innovations.
