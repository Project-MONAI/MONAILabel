## MONAI Label Plugin for OHIF Viewer
The Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF) Viewer is an open-source, web-based platform for medical imaging. OHIF Viewer provides a framework for building complex imaging applications with user-friendly interfaces. MONAI Label supports the web-based OHIF viewer with connectivity to a remote DICOM server via DICOMweb.

### Supported Applications
Supported applications can be found in the [sample-apps](../../sample-apps/radiology/) folder under the radiology section. These applications include models like DeepEdit, DeepGrow, Segmentation, and more, which can be used to create and refine labels for various medical imaging tasks.

### Installing OHIF
When installing MONAI Label with `pip install monailabel`, a version of OHIF that is pre-built with the MONAI Label library is automatically installed. OHIF will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ohif/ when you start the MONAI Label server and connect to local/remote DICOM-web storage.

#### Development setup

To build the OHIF plugin for development, follow these steps:
  ```bash
  sudo sh requirements.sh # installs yarn
  sh build.sh
  ```

To run Orthanc from the submodule and avoid building the OHIF package for every code change, use the following commands:
```bash
cd plugins/ohif/Viewers

yarn run dev:orthanc

# OHIF will run at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```
You can then visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/ on your browser to see the running OHIF.

### Installing Orthanc (DICOMWeb)

#### Ubuntu 20.x

```bash
# Install Orthanc and DICOMweb plugin
sudo apt-get install orthanc orthanc-dicomweb -y

# Install Plastimatch
sudo apt-get install plastimatch -y
```

However, you must upgrade to the latest version by following the steps mentioned on the [Orthanc Installation Guide](https://book.orthanc-server.com/users/debian-packages.html#replacing-the-package-from-the-service-by-the-lsb-binaries)

```bash
sudo service orthanc stop
sudo wget https://lsb.orthanc-server.com/orthanc/1.9.7/Orthanc --output-document /usr/sbin/Orthanc
sudo rm -f /usr/share/orthanc/plugins/*.so

sudo wget https://lsb.orthanc-server.com/orthanc/1.9.7/libServeFolders.so --output-document /usr/share/orthanc/plugins/libServeFolders.so
sudo wget https://lsb.orthanc-server.com/orthanc/1.9.7/libModalityWorklists.so --output-document /usr/share/orthanc/plugins/libModalityWorklists.so
sudo wget https://lsb.orthanc-server.com/plugin-dicom-web/1.6/libOrthancDicomWeb.so --output-document /usr/share/orthanc/plugins/libOrthancDicomWeb.so

sudo service orthanc restart
```

#### Windows/Others _(latest version)_

- Download and Install Orthanc from https://www.orthanc-server.com/download.php

### Converting NIFTI images to DICOM
To use Orthanc, your files need to be in DICOM format. You can convert any Nifti files to DICOM using the following command:
```bash
plastimatch convert --patient-id patient1 --input image.nii.gz --output-dicom test
```
- `plastimatch convert`: This is the command to run the conversion tool.
- `--patient-id patient1`: This option specifies the ID of the patient to be associated with the DICOM files. In this example, it is set to `patient1`.
- `--input image.nii.gz`: This option specifies the path to the input Nifti file that you want to convert to DICOM. In this example, the input file is `image.nii.gz`.
- `--output-dicom test`: This option specifies the path to the output folder where the DICOM files will be saved. In this example, the output folder is named `test`.

When you run this command, plastimatch will read the input Nifti file and convert it to a series of DICOM files with the specified patient ID. These files will be saved in the test folder in DICOM format, which can be uploaded to an Orthanc server.

### Converting NIFTI Annotations to DICOM-SEG

If you want to upload image annotations to the DICOMWeb server (such as Orthanc), you should use DICOM-SEG format. DICOM-SEG is a DICOM standard format for image segmentation. To convert NIFTI annotations to DICOM-SEG, you can use the itkimage2segimage tool from ITK (Insight Toolkit).

Here's how to use itkimage2segimage to convert NIFTI annotations to DICOM-SEG:

1. Install ITK: You can download and install ITK from their website, or use a package manager such as pip or conda to install it.
2. Convert NIFTI annotations to NIFTI-Segmentations: Use the `plastimatch convert` command to convert the NIFTI annotations to NIFTI-Segmentations format. This format is required as an input to `itkimage2segimage`. The command is similar to the one used to convert NIFTI images to DICOM, but with an additional option:

```bash
plastimatch convert --input annotations.nii.gz --output-nifti-seg annotations-seg.nii.gz
```
This command will convert the NIFTI annotations file named `annotations.nii.gz` to NIFTI-Segmentations format and save the result in a file named `annotations-seg.nii.gz`.

3. Convert NIFTI-Segmentations to DICOM-SEG: Use the `itkimage2segimage` command to convert the NIFTI-Segmentations file to DICOM-SEG format. Here's an example command:

```bash
itkimage2segimage --inputImage annotations-seg.nii.gz --outputDICOM annotations-seg.dcm --patientID patient1
```
This command will convert the `annotations-seg.nii.gz` file to DICOM-SEG format and save the result in a file named `annotations-seg.dcm`. The `--patientID` option specifies the ID of the patient to be associated with the DICOM-SEG file.

After conversion, you can upload the DICOM-SEG file to the DICOMWeb server such as Orthanc.


### Uploading DICOM to Orthanc

#### Use Orthanc Browser
You can use the Orthanc browser located at http://127.0.0.1:8042/app/explorer.html#upload to upload files.

#### Using STORE SCP/SCU
To upload files using STORE SCP/SCU, you need to enable AET by editing the `orthanc.json` file:
`sudo vim /etc/orthanc/orthanc.json`

```json5
// The list of the known DICOM modalities
"DicomModalities" : {
/**
 * Uncommenting the following line would enable Orthanc to
 * connect to an instance of the "storescp" open-source DICOM
 * store (shipped in the DCMTK distribution) started by the
 * command line "storescp 2000".
 **/
"sample": ["MONAILABEL", "127.0.0.1", 104]
```
Then, restart Orthanc:

```
sudo service orthanc restart
```

#### Upload Files
To upload files, use the following command:

```bash
python -m pynetdicom storescu 127.0.0.1 4242 test -aet MONAILABEL -r
```
That's it! With these steps, you should have successfully installed MONAI Label with the OHIF viewer plugin and connected it to a remote DICOM server via DICOMweb.
