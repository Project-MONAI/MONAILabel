## Introduction


Welcome to Project MONAILabel! We're excited you're here and want to contribute. This documentation is intended for individuals and institutions interested in contributing to MONAILabel. MONAILabel is an open-source project and, as such, its success relies on its community of contributors willing to keep improving it. Your contribution will be a valued addition to the code base; we simply ask that you read this page and understand our contribution process, whether you are a seasoned open-source contributor or whether you are a first-time contributor.

### Communicate with us

We are happy to talk with you about your needs for MONAILabel and your ideas for contributing to the project. One way to do this is to create an issue discussing your thoughts. It might be that a very similar feature is under development or already exists, so an issue is a great starting point. If you are looking for an issue to resolve that will help Project MONAILabel, see the [*good first issue*](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [*Contribution wanted*](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/labels/Contribution%20wanted) labels.

## The contribution process

>In progress.  Please wait for more instructions to follow

  - Before submitting Pull Request make sure basic CI checks are passed.

    Install `pre-commit` if you have not already.
    ```
    python -m pip install pre-commit
    ```
    Run `pre-commit` check from MonaiLabel working directory.
    ```
    cd MonaiLabel
    python -m pre_commit run --all-files
    ```
    Run additional checks.
    ```
    ./runtests.sh --codeformat
    ./runtests.sh --unittests
    ```
    Run integration checks.
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/monailabel/scripts
    ./runtests.sh --net
    ```
    Stricter static checks.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ./runtests.sh --codeformat
    ```


### Signing your work
MONAILabel enforces the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) on all pull requests.
All commit messages should contain the `Signed-off-by` line with an email address. The [GitHub DCO app](https://github.com/apps/dco) is deployed on MONAILabel. The pull request's status will be `failed` if commits do not contain a valid `Signed-off-by` line.

Git has a `-s` (or `--signoff`) command-line option to append this automatically to your commit message:
```bash
git commit -s -m 'a new commit'
```
The commit message will be:
```
    a new commit

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <yourname@example.org>
```
