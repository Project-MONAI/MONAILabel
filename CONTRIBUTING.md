## Introduction


Welcome to Project MONAILabel! We're excited you're here and want to contribute. This documentation is intended for individuals and institutions interested in contributing to MONAILabel. MONAILabel is an open-source project and, as such, its success relies on its community of contributors willing to keep improving it. Your contribution will be a valued addition to the code base; we simply ask that you read this page and understand our contribution process, whether you are a seasoned open-source contributor or whether you are a first-time contributor.

### Communicate with us

We are happy to talk with you about your needs for MONAILabel and your ideas for contributing to the project. One way to do this is to create an issue discussing your thoughts. It might be that a very similar feature is under development or already exists, so an issue is a great starting point. If you are looking for an issue to resolve that will help Project MONAILabel, see the [*good first issue*](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [*Contribution wanted*](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/labels/Contribution%20wanted) labels.
