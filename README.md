MONAI Label is a server-client system that facilitates interactive medical image annotation by using AI. It is an
open-source and easy-to-install ecosystem that can run locally on a machine with one or two GPUs. Both server and client
work on the same/different machine. However, initial support for multiple users is restricted. It shares the same
principles with [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI).

  monailabel apps --download --name deepedit --output apps
  monailabel datasets --download --name Task02_Heart --output datasets
  
  # run server (ubuntu)

  # run server (windows)
  monailabel start_server --app apps\deepedit --studies datasets\Task02_Heart\imagesTr
  
```

For **_prerequisites_**, other installation methods (using the default GitHub branch, using Docker, etc.), please refer
to the [installation guide](https://docs.monai.io/projects/label/en/latest/installation.html).

> Once you start the MONAI Label Server, by default it will be up and serving at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Open the serving URL in browser. It will provide you the list of Rest APIs available.

### 3D Slicer

Download **Preview Release** from https://download.slicer.org/ and install MONAI Label plugin from Slicer Extension
Manager.

Refer [3D Slicer plugin](plugins/slicer) for other options to install and run MONAI Label plugin in 3D Slicer.
> To avoid accidentally using an older Slicer version, you may want to _uninstall_ any previously installed 3D Slicer package.

### OHIF [WIP]

MONAI Label comes with pre-built plugin for [OHIF Viewer](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers).
> Please install [Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/download.php) before using OHIF Viewer.
> For Ubuntu 20.x, Orthanc can be installed as `apt-get install orthanc orthanc-dicomweb`. However, you have to **upgrade to latest version** by following steps mentioned [here](https://book.orthanc-server.com/users/debian-packages.html#replacing-the-package-from-the-service-by-the-lsb-binaries)
>
> You can use [PlastiMatch](https://plastimatch.org/plastimatch.html#plastimatch-convert) to convert NIFTI to DICOM

> OHIF Viewer will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ohif/ after running the following command:

`(cd plugins/ohif && ./build.sh)`
