MONAI Label is an intelligent open source image labeling and learning tool that enables users to create annotated datasets and build AI annotation models for clinical evaluation. MONAI Label enables application developers to build labeling apps in a serverless way, where custom labeling apps are exposed as a service through the MONAI Label Server.

MONAI Label is a server-client system that facilitates interactive medical image annotation by using AI. It is an
open-source and easy-to-install ecosystem that can run locally on a machine with single or multiple GPUs. Both server
and client work on the same/different machine. It shares the same principles
with [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI).

Refer to [MONAI Label Tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/monailabel) series for application and viewer workflows with different medical image tasks. Notebook-like tutorials are created for detailed instructions.

### Overview
MONAI Label reduces the time and effort of annotating new datasets and enables the adaptation of AI to the task at hand by continuously learning from user interactions and data. MONAI Label allows researchers and developers to make continuous improvements to their apps by allowing them to interact with their apps at the user would. End-users (clinicians, technologists, and annotators in general) benefit from AI continuously learning and becoming better at understanding what the end-user is trying to annotate.

MONAI Label aims to fill the gap between developers creating new annotation applications, and the end users which want to benefit from these innovations.

#### Supported Matrix

MONAI Label supports many state-of-the-art(SOTA) models in Model-Zoo, and their integration with viewers and monaibundle app. Please refer to [monaibundle](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/sample-apps/monaibundle) app page for supported models, including whole body segmentation, whole brain segmentation, lung nodule detection, tumor segmentation and many more.

In addition, you can find a table of the basic supported fields, modalities, viewers, and general data types.  However, these are only ones that we've explicitly test and that doesn't mean that your dataset or file type won't work with MONAI Label.  Try MONAI for your given task and if you're having issues, reach out through GitHub Issues.

## Step 3 MONAI Label Supported Viewers

### Radiology
#### 3D Slicer
3D Slicer, a free and open-source platform for analyzing, visualizing and understanding medical image data. In MONAI Label, 3D Slicer is most tested with radiology studies and algorithms, develpoment and integration.

[3D Slicer Setup](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/slicer)

#### OHIF
The Open Health Imaging Foundation (OHIF) Viewer is an open source, web-based, medical imaging platform. It aims to provide a core framework for building complex imaging applications.

[OHIF Setup](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/ohif)

### Pathology
#### QuPath
Quantitative Pathology & Bioimage Analysis (QuPath) is an open, powerful, flexible, extensible software platform for bioimage analysis.

[QuPath Setup](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/qupath)

#### Digital Slide Archive
The Digital Slide Archive (DSA) is a platform that provides the ability to store, manage, visualize and annotate large imaging data sets.
[Digital Slide Archive Setup](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/dsa)

### Video
#### CVAT
CVAT is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.
[CVAT Setup](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main/plugins/cvat)

## Step 4 Data Preparation
For data preparation, you have two options, you can use a local data store or any image archive tool that supports DICOMWeb.

#### Local Datastore for the Radiology App on single modality images
For a Datastore in a local file archive, there is a set folder structure that MONAI Label uses. Place your image data in a folder and if you have any segmentation files, create and place them in a subfolder called `labels/final`. You can see an example below:
```
dataset
│-- spleen_10.nii.gz
│-- spleen_11.nii.gz
│   ...
└───labels
    └─── final
        │-- spleen_10.nii.gz
        │-- spleen_11.nii.gz
        │   ...
```

If you don't have labels, just place the images/volumes in the dataset folder.

#### DICOMWeb Support
If the viewer you're using supports DICOMweb standard, you can use that instead of a local datastore to serve images to MONAI Label. When starting the MONAI Label server, we need to specify the URL of the DICOMweb service in the studies argument (and, optionally, the username and password for DICOM servers that require them). You can see an example of starting the MONAI Label server with a DICOMweb URL below:


```
monailabel start_server --app apps/radiology --studies http://127.0.0.1:8042/dicom-web --conf models segmentation
```

## Step 5 Start MONAI Label Server and Start Annotating
You're now ready to start using MONAI Label.  Once you've configured your viewer, app, and datastore, you can launch the MONAI Label server with the relevant parameters. For simplicity, you can see an example where we download a Radiology sample app and dataset, then start the MONAI Label server below:

```
monailabel apps --download --name radiology --output apps
monailabel datasets --download --name Task09_Spleen --output datasets
monailabel start_server --app apps/radiology --studies datasets/Task09_Spleen/imagesTr --conf models segmentation
```

**Note:** If you want to work on different labels than the ones proposed by default, change the configs file following the instructions here: https://youtu.be/KtPE8m0LvcQ?t=622
