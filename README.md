MONAI Label is a server-client system that facilitates interactive medical image annotation by using AI. It is an
open-source and easy-to-install ecosystem that can run locally on a machine with one or two GPUs. Both server and client
work on the same/different machine. However, initial support for multiple users is restricted. It shares the same
principles with [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI).
